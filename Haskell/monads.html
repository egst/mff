== type ==
A possibly parametrized type is defined
by assigning to a property of the type proxy.
To define an unparametrized type, simply assign the definition proxy ($).
To define a parametrized type, assign a curried function
taking the type parameters and returning the definition proxy.

type.Foo = $...
defines an unparametrized type Foo

type.Bar = t => u => $...
defines a type Bar parametrized by two types.

The definition proxy provoides ways to define various constructs
such as constructors of the types, or conversion from vanilla JS objects.

== literal ==

A "low level implemented" function that provides conversion
from vanilla JS objects to HM-typed objects.
No type checks occur, the conversion is meant to be duck-typed
and should accept any value with appropriate conversion or some fallback value.
There should be at most one literal per type.

type.Type = $.literal.Lit(vanilla => result)
Lit(x) constructs the HM type representing the result value.

== ctor ==
A "more abstract" function simply providing the internal data of the HM type.
Multiple constructors may be defined per type.

Nullary functions are often replaced by getters in this framework,
so the empty () are not required (and not expected) to call the function:
type.Type = t => $.ctor.CtorNullary()
Type.CtorNullary will construct the type.

...ctor.CtorSingle(t)
Type.CtorSingle(x) will construct the type provided that x is of the type t.

Different types may be composed into function types:
...ctor.CtorFunc(t(Integer))
Type.CtorFunc(x) where x is of type Integer -> t,
aka a function taking an Integer and returing t (later on written a x :: Integer -> t)

Multuple parameters bay be provided in a more JS-ish way:
...ctor.CtorParams(t, Integer)
Type.CtorParams(x, y) were x :: t, y :: Integer

or in a more Haskell-ish way (curried):
...ctor.CtorCurry(t)(Integer)
Type.CtorCurry(x)(y) where x :: t, y :: Integer

Arbitrary (completely polymorphic or somehow restricted) types
may be introduced into the definition:
...ctor.CtorPoly(u => Integer(t, u))
Type.CtorPoly(x) where x :: (t, u) -> Integer

It might be impractical to use such types (where their parameters are completely polymorphic)
since the functions later defined for them might have a problem accessing the underlying data
without the knowledge of the underlying type.
It is usefull, however, to define some restrictions of the newly introduced types with type classes:
...ctor.CtorRestr(u => v => assert(Numerical(u), Natural(v), v(t, u)))
Type.CtorRests(x) where x :: v(t, u) where u is Numerical, v is Natural

The assert(r0, ..., rN, result) function checks the constraints r0, ..., rN
and returns the last parameter - result.
In this contexts the constraints are type classes, which are basically relations,
that are satisfied when the given types are in the type class.

The resulting type is basically just a record/struct of the arguments
given in the constructor + the constructor itself.
